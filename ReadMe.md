hi 
this is a repo containing my setup for offline cloning and exporting of crates.io and rustup
you should have cargo & git installed
to setup a cloning folder:
1. clone the repo
2. run `make init` 
3. run `make sync` to download all crates
4. run `make pack ` to copy all crates changed since the commit
